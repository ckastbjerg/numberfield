# Numberfield

> A small numberfield challenge


## Installation

run `yarn` or `npm install` to install dependencies


## Starting the project

Run `yarn start` or `npm start`. This will start up a local development server running on localhost:3000 with hot-reloading.


## Solving the challenge

In the `src` folder, you will find a `Numberfield` component. The component is initialized from the `App` component.

Your challenge is, to make this component work in the nicest way possible given the props it receives. There is no fixed solution to the challenge.
